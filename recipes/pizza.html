<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pizza always makes a bad day feel better, and there is nothing nicer than a perfect slice of margherita pizza. Now you can make this recipe at home any time the craving strikes!</p>
<p>Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples. When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
<li> 1 bacth whole wheat pizza dough or 1 pound store bougth pizza dough</li>
<li> 1 large can whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
<li> 12 ounces (dry weight) ovoline-type mozarella or other fresh mozzarella balls, ideally water-packed</li>
<li> Handful of fresh basil, thinly sliced plus small leaves</li>
<li>Aditional gaenishes:
    Drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil
    Flaky salt or kosher salt
    Optional red pepper flakes</li>
<ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>        
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. If you are using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. Prepare dough through step 5.</li>
    <li>Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl, juices and all. Crush the tomatoes by hand. Spread about ¾ cup of the tomato sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges.</li>
    <li>If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain off the water and gently pat the mozzarella dry on a clean tea towel or paper towels. If you are working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into smaller 1-inch balls. Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit more in the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.</li>
    <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just turning golden, about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you are using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
    <li>Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light back-and-forth drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkling of salt, and red pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy. Leftover pizza will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>MAKE IT DAIRY FREE/VEGAN: While untraditional, this pizza would be good with vegan sour cream drizzled across the pizza both before and after baking. Simply omit the Parmesan in the pizza crust recipe.</p>
<p>MAKE IT GLUTEN FREE: Substitute your favorite homemade or store-bought pizza dough.</p>
